# Huffman-Coding
A Java implementation of the algorithms associated with Huffman Coding text file compression.

# How do I run this thing?
The program expects 5 .txt files as command line, 1 character frequency table and 4 text files for outputting debug information. In the 'Test_Input' Directory I have provided samples.
Upon execution, the program will generate an encoded file according to the huffman encoding scheme and it will then decode the file and output that in another file.
Those files will be called yourInputFileName_Compressed/Decompressed.txt and they will be written your working directory.
